    <h1>Payment and Refund Policy</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 18, 2025</div>
    
    <p>This policy outlines the terms related to payments and refunds for all services and products offered by BHC HOLDINGS SDN BHD. Please read this policy carefully before making any purchase.</p>
    
    <h2>1. General Terms</h2>
    <p><strong>Payment Processor:</strong> All payments made on https://lifetune.cornerv.com/LIFE.TUNE_my are processed through our secure third-party payment gateway, Razorpay Curlec Sdn Bhd. You can find their terms and conditions on their respective website.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Currency:</strong> All prices are stated and charged in MYR.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change the prices of our services at any time. For subscriptions, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Subscriptions (AI Bot Services)</h2>
    <p><strong>Billing Cycle:</strong> We offer monthly and yearly subscription plans. Your subscription will begin as soon as your initial payment is processed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (either monthly or yearly) unless you cancel it. You will be charged the subscription fee for the next period on your renewal date.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting our support team at administrator@lifetuneapp.com. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current paid term. You will continue to have access to the service until the end of your billing period.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Subscription Refunds:</strong> Subscription fees are non-refundable. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, unused services, or accidental renewals.</p>
    
    <h2>3. One-Time Purchases (Reports and Assessments)</h2>
    <p><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> All reports and assessments are digital products that are generated and made available to you immediately after your payment is successfully processed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Refunds for One-Time Purchases:</strong> Due to their instant, digital nature, all one-time purchases of reports and assessments are final and non-refundable. Once a report has been generated and delivered, we cannot offer a refund.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> A refund may be considered only in cases of a documented technical error where you paid for a report or assessment but did not receive it. If you encounter such an issue, please contact our support team at administrator@lifetuneapp.com within 48 hours of your purchase with your transaction details.</p>
